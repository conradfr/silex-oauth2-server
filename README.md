OAuth 2 server Silex service provider
=====================================

A Silex service provider for implementing an OAuth 2 server, using the [lncd/OAuth2](https://github.com/lncd/OAuth2) library.

Note 05/2015: I forked the repository back then because the lib was not working properly but I do not use it anymore and don't maintain it. I see that several people have forked this repo so maybe you should check those updated fork instead.
